Rust library crate for working with univariate polynomials.

## TODO list:
- split the lib.rs into smaller modules
- provide a method for evaluating a polynomial
- implement the division of two polynomials
- provide documentation for all the functionality
- provide a method for calculating the derivative
- allow the indeterminate symbol to be changed
- add more content to this README file
